# Botty
This is a repo where i am trying my hands-on NLP and trying to make an ai chatbot using it which possibly generate random answer for some of the pre-assumed questions as well as some hard coated answers for which ever purpose it is built for,
 also making websites to display this bot onto with a page for the creators of this bot and members of the project with their intros and socials.
